# create-pdf-with-python
In this project we try playing with fpdf2 module of python to create pdf files. 

If you have never used python. Download it from their official website, just make sure you check the "Add to path" option in the installer. 

Next? 
type "pip install fpdf2"
onced it is finished downloading, run the .py files with:

type "python filename.py"

It will generate a new pdf file for you that you can design within your code.
